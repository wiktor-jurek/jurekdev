# Authentication
How do we access systems?
Well, there are three steps to gaining access to a system.

1. Identification - "Here's who I am!"
2. Authentication - "Is this really you?"
3. Authorisation - "In you come!"

We'll primarily be looking at authentication.
To successfully authenticate, we have to *prove* who we are, and we can do this by multiple factors:

1. Knowledge - Something you *know*.
2. Token - Something you *have*.
3. Biometric - Something you *are*.

Two factor authentication is gaining a lot of popularity. It's an increase in security at very little cost.
